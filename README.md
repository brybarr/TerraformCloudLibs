# Terraform Modules Library

This repository forms the basis of my own personal implimentation of a Terraform Modules Library.

It's made up of pre-coded modules to get you started quickly.

It also uses tools, such as TFEnv, Terraform Docs, Linters, VSCode's Dev / Remote containers and many more to provide effectively a Terraform / DevOps engineer development lab to develop and test Terraform Modules.

You are most welcome and in fact encouraged to contribute back to this repository.

## Demo

A quick video walk through demo of this solution

![Terraform Modules Library](images/demo.gif?raw=true "Terraform Modules Library")

## Instructions

- Install VSCode, Docker Desktop and Git
- Clone this repository locally
- Create a new branch to work on
- Open the repository folder in VSCode and remeber to launch in Remote Dev Container
- Create your module folder in the designated cloud module's folder (remember to add an empty terragrunt.hcl file)
- See custom/modules/example for template module
- Start writing your Terraform code, you can use Terraform plan etc. just as you'd normally do
- Periodically run in the VSCode Terminal ./run.sh to check your Terraform Syntax and create your Terraform Documentation for you
- Once you are done, push your code to your branch remote and open a Pull Request on Github
- Ask for reviewers, and make the required changes
- Once you are done, your Module code will be merged to main branch

## Goals

- Provide a delightful developer experience
- Consistent workflows, tools and versions
- Continuously reduce toil and increase automation
- Enable education and encourage learning and development
- Build in security and compliance
- Build internal communities through advocacy
- Employ pragmatic standardization

## Cloud Operating Model

![Unlocking the Cloud Operating Model](images/unlocking-the-cloud-operating-model.png)

## Features

This repository uses some best practice tools to help us with our modules. Tools such as TFENV which automatically installs the correct Terraform Version, Terraform Docs and Terraform Lint, the comprehensive feature list is detailed below.

| Product | State |
|-------|---------|
| VSCode Dev Container | ✓ |
| Pre-Commit | ✓ |
| Terratest | ✘ |
| Terraform | ✓ |
| Terragrunt | ✓ |
| TFEnv | ✓ |
| TGEnv | ✓ |
| TFsec | ✓ |
| AWS | ✓ |
| GCP | ✓ |
| Azure | ✓ |
| Custom | ✓ |
| Terraform Lint | ✓ |
| Terraform Format | ✓ |
| Terraform Validate | ✓ |

- Pre-commit: Runs pre-commit with the given config in `.pre-commit-config.yaml.

- Linters: terraform-lint tflint yamllint

- Terraform lint: terraform fmt -check -recursive -diff

- Terraform format: terraform fmt -check -recursive -diff

- Clean: Clean up .terraform and .terrgrunt-cache folders

- Terraform docs: Create README.md files for each Terraform Module on the fly, generated from your code

- Terraform Plan: Using Terragrunt we run a plan on all modules

## Getting started

Please install the following software

- Docker Desktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download (with Remote development in Containers extension) https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial
- Clone this repository
- Now Open VSCode and Open this repository

:bulb: Let's look at some Screenshots of Opening your project

In VSCode, click File -> Open Folder and navigate to this project
![VSCode open repository folder](images/vscode-open-repository-folder.png?raw=true "VSCode open repository folder")

If you have installed the Devcontainer Extension in the previous step, you'd see a Notification, bottom Right.

__Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container__ and click `Reopen in Container`

![VSCode open repository folder open in devcontainer](images/vscode-open-repository-folder-open-in-devcontainer.png?raw=true "VSCode open repository folder open in devcontainer")

You will see the Docker Build log bottom right and once done, you will see the files of the project in VSCode.

![VSCode open repository folder open in devcontainer docker build
log](images/vscode-open-repository-folder-open-in-devcontainer-build-log.png?raw=true "VSCode open repository folder open in
devcontainer docker build log")

Now you can open a new Terminal. This will launch a new terminal inside the container, you will note that Terraform, Terragrunt and all the tools this project needs has already been installed for you.

![VSCode open repository folder open in devcontainer new Terminal](images/vscode-open-repository-folder-open-in-devcontainer-new-terminal.png?raw=true "VSCode open repository folder open in devcontainer new Terminal")

Now you need to Authenticate to your Clouds, see: __Authenticating__ below.

## Authenticating

Somewhere someone or something has to authenticate against the clouds, the pipeline will take care of this for you, however if you are developing locally, you need to take care of this yourself.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_REGION=

export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=

export ARM_CLIENT_ID=
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=
export ARM_TENANT_ID=
```

## Example output

When you run ./run.sh you will get the following output

`ubuntu@0c9b71981e0b:/app$ ./run.sh`

```

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.debug will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "debug" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + triggers = {
          + "module_folder"            = "/app/custom/modules/debug"
          + "module_name"              = "debug"
          + "module_written_for_cloud" = "custom"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

## Contributing

### Adding/Changing a Module

1. Create a new git branch e.g. `feature/xxxxxx`
2. Either `cd` into the module folder and make the changes e.g. `modules/debug/` or create a new module.
3. Run `terraform init` to install providers for the module
4. Run `terraform fmt -check -recursive` to format any changes.
5. If format is successful run `terraform validate`
6. If validate is successful run `terraform plan`

## Testing

1. To test a Terraform module, use a test module (module/xxxxxx/test/)
2. When test module is ready for a Terraform module, run `run.sh` to check the result

## Debugging

At some stage of the game you will need to debug something, this setup, automates away a lot of toil, but with these automation and abstraction comes a lack of visibility.

- Make `make -dn docs` use the -dn flag for make

## FAQs

- Why are You using a Mono Repo?
I try to avoid code duplication and as a small team, to avoid this developers commit hell cycle, I opted for a Mono repo, you are welcome to split it up. You can always use the individual modules using the Terraform Source `source = "git::git@github.com:star3am/terraform-modules-library.git//aws/modules/debug?ref=main"`

## Gotchas

- You will see in the terragrunt.hcl files where I detect the module source I post-fix it with `//.` see this bug: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1675

- fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/app' To add an exception for this directory see this page: https://www.kenmuse.com/blog/avoiding-dubious-ownership-in-dev-containers/

- I've not found a way to force no-cache so sometimes you need to say ReBuild and ReOpen in Container.

## Thanks!

Many thanks goes to the team at Gruntwork https://gruntwork.io/ for their amazing effort and for selflessly sharing their code in the great spirit of Open Source. In fact https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example inspired this repo and set the foundation for this repo.
